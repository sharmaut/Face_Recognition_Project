# Face_Recognition_Project
This project aims to build a real-time face recognition system that detects and identifies individuals from a live video stream using a webcam. The system is designed to be used in personal computer access, and online meeting authentication. 
Technologies Used:
Python: The primary language used for building the project, chosen for its versatility and extensive libraries tailored for AI and computer vision. 
OpenCV: Used for capturing real-time video from the webcam, processing video frames, and displaying results. It proved to be an essential tool for handling video input/output and image processing tasks efficiently. 
The face_recognition library facilitated the detection and recognition of faces from the live video feed. It provided the means to encode facial features and compare them against a stored database of known individuals. It helped in training the model to create unique face representations.
